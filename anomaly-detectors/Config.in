	help
	  This is for the developers to make changes to the package source code
	  without having to download the entire thing from git-hub.

	string "Local source location (directory)"
	help
	  List the directory where your local copy of the source code can be found.
	  For example: '/home/username/anomaly_detectors/'
	  The path should end with a trailing / and that directory could be the root of
	  where your source for the code is.

config ANOMALY_DETECTORS_GDB
	bool "Compile with support for GDB"
	select PACKAGE_gdb
	default n
	help
	  If you would like to run the program through GDB, enable this option.
	  This is no reason to enable this unless you are a developer on the project.
